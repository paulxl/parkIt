### TLG Team 3: JS Final Project Front-End

#### Team Armageddon Firehose

- Paul Lewis
- Bradley Pratt
- Randall Wade

#### Overview

The team was to create a full-stack project with CRUD. It was done in a short sprint(4 work days and 2 weekend days).

We chose to create a park project. Where users can find parks in the state of Washington. These are displayed on a mapbox map. The CRUD comes from users being able to see group hike/bike/run trips to specific trails. These can be read, created, updated, and deleted.

#### Technology Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Leaflet (mapbox)
- Miro (online whiteboard used to collaberate)
- GitHub
- Adobe Connect
- Microsoft Teams
- Heroku

#### Data Used

We used three APIs for points to map: A US Gov Parks API, a Washington State Parks API, and a GIS Manager for Washington State API for local Parks. And we used a Sunrise/Sunset API.

The parks API data was pushed into a backend API for ease of use.
